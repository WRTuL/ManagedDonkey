## What is this?
 - This is Donkey, a project I started back in August 2022 after years of reverse engineering the Halo engine and learning C++ while I went.
 - I wanted to write my own take on what a Halo mod should be and started going to town, putting all the information I had in my head into one place that others could use it (**Except for Faber**).

## Getting started-ish
 - Files for use with Donkey are on the [File Share](https://github.com/twist84/DonkeyFileShare).
 - For Building
   - Git and Powershell, only for the last commit revision
 - For Debugging: Visual Studio 2022 Extensions
   - [Smart Command Line Arguments VS2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MBulli.SmartCommandlineArguments2022)
   - [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool2022)

## How can I help?
 - Mostly just by testing Donkey out.
 - Ideas are welcome.
 - I don't want outside contributions, though, since this is my own project.
